Unidad 1

Algorithm - seguir una serie de instrucciones paso a paso. An ordered sequence of steps for carrying out tasks

-check what assumptions we make when designing an algorithm

1- brush your teeth
2 draw a kite

1

For programming weÂ´ll use the SCRATCH website
Scratch.mit.edu

Concepts:
Selection (if)
	-This works with true or false statements
	- Involves the use of conditions to control the flow of the programm and make decisions
Pseudocode
	-Description of the algorithm that uses natural lenguage
Iteration
	-repetition, forever repeat, infinite loops
